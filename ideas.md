# Street Rabbit Studio - Design Brainstorm

## Design Direction Exploration

### Response 1: Brutalist Minimalism with Neon Accents
**Probability: 0.08**

**Design Movement:** Brutalist Design + High-Tech Minimalism

**Core Principles:**
- Raw, unpolished surfaces with intentional imperfection
- Stark contrast and geometric precision
- Strategic use of negative space as a design element
- Neon accents as disruptive focal points

**Color Philosophy:**
- Deep black backgrounds (#0a0a0a) create an immersive, gallery-like environment
- Pure white (#ffffff) for typography and structural elements
- Deep pink (#ff1493 or #e91e63) as the primary brand color, applied with restraint
- Neon pink highlights (#ff006e) used sparingly on interactive elements or key CTAs
- The darkness frames the pink, making it feel luxurious and intentional

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetrical grid with deliberate white space
- Left-aligned typography with right-aligned imagery
- Full-width sections with varied padding to create rhythm
- Horizontal dividers and geometric shapes to break monotony
- Portfolio items displayed in a masonry-like scattered grid

**Signature Elements:**
- Sharp geometric shapes (rectangles, diagonal cuts) as dividers

- Large, bold typography with generous letter-spacing
- Monochromatic photography with selective color (pink highlights)

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Hover states reveal neon pink accents
- Smooth fade transitions between sections
- Click-to-expand portfolio items with minimal animation
- Subtle parallax on scroll for depth without distraction

**Animation:**
- Fade-in on scroll for portfolio items
- Smooth color transitions on hover (white to pink)

**CHOSEN: Brutalist Minimalism with Neon Accents**

This approach aligns perfectly with Street Rabbit's premium, bold, and confident brand identity. The brutalist foundation ensures sophistication without playfulness, while neon accents provide the modern edge that distinguishes a high-end creative studio.
